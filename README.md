# AvaloniaApplicationDataTemplate
A simple project using Avalonia UI, data-bindings and data-templates.

Avalonia is a multiplatform UI framework for .NET. It's similar to WPF and uses the same XAML structure, but can be launched also in Mac, Linux and Android.
Unlike MAUI that is not available on Linux.

I've tried to make a simple app using general features and this framework made a good impression on me. 
You don't need to learn it specially because you only need to know WPF. 
I created this app using Ubuntu and Rider, and Rider provides a great support for Avalonia, for example a XAML previewer that immediately shows your test data
(WPF requires special actions to do the same) and intellisense tooltips in XAML. 
Also WPF not always works stable and requires relaunch VisualStudio from time to time, but I haven't noticed the same here.

It was interesting experience and now I know that I can create UI on Linux with C#.
